  <h1>Nambu-kai — Interactive Mouse Heatmap</h1>

  <!--============ Introduction / Rationale ============-->
  <section>
    <h2>Introduction & Rationale</h2>
    <p>
      This heatmap shows downsampled temperature data for multiple mice over a 
      14-day period. Each row represents one mouse, and each column is a time bin 
      (e.g., every 20 minutes). The color indicates the average temperature in 
      that time bin.
    </p>
    <p>
      I chose a heatmap because plotting 13 (or more) overlapping lines quickly 
      becomes visually cluttered. A “time vs. mouse” grid makes it easy to spot 
      patterns, compare mice, and identify hot or cool periods without line 
      overlap.
    </p>

  <!--============ Data Transformations ============-->
  <section>
    <h2>Data Transformations & Color Palette</h2>
    <p>
      I start with a wide CSV file containing columns for each mouse (e.g., 
      <code>f1, f2, ... f13</code>) plus a row index for each minute. I convert 
      this to a “long” format: <code>{ mouseID, minute, temperature }</code>. Then 
      I “bin” the data into 20-minute intervals by taking the mean temperature 
      within each bin (e.g., minutes <code>0..19</code> become bin <code>0</code>, 
      minutes <code>20..39</code> become bin <code>1</code>, etc.). This 
      aggregation reduces clutter and speeds up rendering.
    </p>
    <p>
      My color palette uses a single-hue orange scale (via 
      <code>d3.interpolateOranges</code>) from pale/light orange for the coolest 
      values to deep/dark orange for the hottest. This approach emphasizes the 
      “heat” aspect of the temperature data in an intuitive, single-hue manner.

  <!--============ Interactions ============-->
  <section>
    <h2>Interactive Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Brushing / Zooming:</strong> A user can drag a brush over part 
      of the time axis to zoom in. I update the x-scale domain and re-render 
      the grid, letting the user inspect a narrower time range in detail.</li>
      <li><strong>Reset Zoom Button:</strong> Clicking this button restores the full 
      14-day domain.</li>
      <li><strong>Mouse Toggles:</strong> Each mouse has a checkbox; users can 
      show or hide any mouse. The heatmap immediately re-renders for only 
      selected mice.</li>
      <li><strong>Tooltips:</strong> Hovering over any cell displays a small box 
      showing the exact mouse, time bin, and temperature.</li>
    </ul>

  <!--============ Development Process ============-->
  <section>
    <h2>Development Process & Team Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Team Name:</strong> Nambu-kai  
      <strong>Team Members:</strong> Takeru Inoue
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Time Spent:</strong> Approximately 10–12 hours in total. The 
      breakdown:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Data Loading & Binning Logic (2–3 hours):</em> I first wrote a 
      script to reshape the wide CSV into a more convenient format and then 
      aggregated by 20-minute bins.</li>
      <li><em>Initial Heatmap Implementation (3–4 hours):</em> I created the 
      rectangle grid with D3, assigned the color scale, and tested small 
      subsets of data for correctness.</li>
      <li><em>Interactions (2 hours):</em> I added brushing/zoom, checkboxes, 
      and tooltips to enhance exploration.</li>
      <li><em>Styling & Final Tweaks (1–2 hours):</em> I polished the color scale, 
      legend design, axis labels, and the “Reset Zoom” button.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Rationale for Final Design:</strong> I initially tried multi-line 
      plots, but they were too crowded with many mice. I considered using multiple 
      subplots but liked having a single, global view via a heatmap. The orange scale 
      effectively conveys “milder/lower temps” in lighter shades and “hotter temps” 
      in darker shades.

  <!--============ Visualization Containers ============-->
  <p>
    Below, I provide checkboxes to toggle each mouse, followed by the interactive 
    heatmap. Use the brush to zoom in on a time range, and click “Reset Zoom” to 
    restore the full domain.
